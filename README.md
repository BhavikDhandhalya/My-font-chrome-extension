I have developed a chrome extension that changes default coding font of every coding website to "Source Code Pro".

In order to work this extension, download "Source Code Pro" fonts.

How to enable this extension.
1. download the folder.
2. Go to chrome, Extension manager.
3. Click on Load extensions. Select folder from the pop-up window.
4. Done

Now go to codeforces.com or https://geeksforgeeks.org and check.
